# AI Terms
### Agent (AI Agent): 
  An AI agent is an autonomous system that uses an LLM to perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions towards achieving a specific goal, often leveraging external tools.
### Large Language Model (LLM): 
  A large language model is a deep learning model trained on a massive dataset of text, capable of understanding, generating, and processing human language.
### Tools (AI Agents): 
  In the context of AI agents, tools are external functions or resources (like APIs or databases) that an agent can utilize to interact with its environment and perform actions beyond its core LLM capabilities.
### Tasks (AI Agents): 
  Tasks are the specific objectives or actions that an AI agent is designed to achieve, ranging from simple information retrieval to complex multi-step processes like planning or problem-solving.
